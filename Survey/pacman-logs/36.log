[2011-01-02 00:39] This wine package is wow64 enabled. This means it can run 32bit/64bit Windows apps on x86_64.
[2011-01-02 00:39] If you are on x86_64, the default WINEARCH will be win64.
[2011-01-02 00:39] This will cause a lot of Windows applications to malfunction even if they usually work in wine.
[2011-01-02 00:39] Please create your ~/.wine with 'WINEARCH=win32 winecfg' if you are unsure and on x86_64.
[2011-01-02 00:39] See the Arch wiki on wine for more information.
