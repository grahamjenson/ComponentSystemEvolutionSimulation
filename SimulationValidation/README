List of assumptions:

----------- Validate the input --------------
Static Validation, face validation
Generated users look like real user actions: face validation -- looking at the partial data set extracted from command line arguments

1) Wider verity of actions that users use (expecially remove/purge)
 --e.g. Commandline: apt-get remove tig
 --However the majority of actions are still only install and upgrade, 5 times as many installs as removes, upgrades are lacking this may be explained by gui applications dedicated to this task eliminating the command line usage
 
2) Batch actions: Days with lots of interactions (this was discussed in the survey)
 --Typically involving solving a particular problem (like getting a program to work, or setting up the system (as discussed in the survey)
 
 --e.g.
Commandline: apt-get purge libjinglep2p0.3-0 libxsettings-client0 liblash2 libmowgli1 librpm0
Commandline: apt-get purge libjinglexmpp0.3-0 librpmio0
Commandline: apt-get purge libjinglexmllite0.3-0
Commandline: apt-get purge libjinglebase0.3-0
Commandline: apt-get purge google-chrome-unstable
Commandline: apt-get purge google-chrome-beta
Commandline: apt-get purge libqt4-webkit-dbg
Commandline: apt-get purge libgnome-desktop-2-17
Commandline: apt-get purge python-gnome2
Commandline: apt-get purge python-gnomekeyring python-gnomeapplet libgnomevfs2-common libgnomevfs2-0 libgnomeui-common libgnomeprintui2.2-common libgnomecanvas2-common libgnome-media0
Commandline: apt-get purge gnome-media-common gnome-games-data
Commandline: apt-get purge libsoup-gnome2.4-1 libxml++2.6-2
Commandline: apt-get purge gnome-cards-data gnome-mime-data gnome-keyring gnome-mplayer
Commandline: apt-get purge libgnome2-common
Commandline: apt-get purge libgnomecups1.0-1 libgnomeprint2.2-0 libgnomeprint2.2-data gnome-icon-theme
Commandline: apt-get purge libgnome-keyring0

A large amount of removes as one of the first actions in this system
 
3) Multiple actions: installing and removing multiple packages in single command
 --e.g. apt-get install quodlibet-ext quodlibet-plugins

4) Dependent commands: Install then remove a package quickly
 --e.g. 
Commandline: apt-get install git-gui
Commandline: apt-get install tig
Commandline: apt-get remove tig
Commandline: apt-get remove git-gui

5)Installation of packages not in the weighted package list
 --e.g. build-essential, gimp both very popular packages
 --most requests package for install in command lines is "initramfs-tools" a low level linux developer tool, and this is probably indicticive of the log selection and command line use by developers

Components are removed: No components removed in simulation, where no component names are removed, but updated components are replaced
New components (named) added: Less than real systems
Components updated: Much less

Size of repository: Ours about 90,000 other about 40,000. Because of the difficulties collecting when packages where changed, we collected all information. Where the repository are maintained to be a smaller set only including the most recent uptodate packages.

6)Multiple name, vesion paris exactly the same, tagged with source or archictecture difference (this differes from the fundamental model)


-------- Validate the output -------------
Dynamic validation
The output from a only update user looks like the real output of that user...
Simulation
updatedPackages = [0, 14, 2, 35, 12, 0, 1, 14, 14, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 6, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]

REAL
realupdatedPackages = [0, 19, 1, 14, 1, 0, 19, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 8, 6, 0, 2, 26, 44, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 16, 2]


Users generated that randomly install users looks like real user output...
installs from user logs (removed greater than 1000): 1519 installs, 0.352863726136 trivial,  9.04805793285 mean installed packages, 23.3263970159 std installed packages, 3 median installed packages
Select the 200 most likely pakcagtes to install, create users that will install them on day 1:
8 installs were already installed, 0.11 were trivial (only 1 package installed), 7.3125 mean change, 9.41387772122 std installed,  6.0 meadian installed
What are the common packages installed by them all?
('kdelibs-data', 52), ('liblualib50', 52), ('kdelibs4c2a', 52), ('libavahi-qt3-1', 52), ('liblua50', 52), ('libqt3-mt', 57), ('libaudio2', 74)

The more trivial packages installed, maybe becuase of users more installing libraries and such that are not in the popular packages list
the mean amount of packages installed is very similar, though the standard deviation is quite disimilar. 
This may be because real users can also install extremly disruptive packges, for example one install that required over 100 packages to be installed was "kubuntu-desktop".
Such packages would not be on a list of recommended install candidates.
 
Conclusions
The user actions are a greatly simplified user
The repository includes significantly more packages and changes per day than what is really observed.
However, the evolutions generated by the simulation, for individual user actions (update and install), have similar properties to observed system evolution properties.
The install action though is restricted given that a user may select many packages to be installed that are not in the list of weighted packages.

This similarity shows that the size and number of changes to the repository has little impact on the users system.
This is likely because many of the changes have no impact on the components in the users system, and therefore are not considred when the system is evolved.
